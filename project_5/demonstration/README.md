# The demonstration

This code is for the classroom demonstration. The brighness master file is the client. It uses two servers (Arduinos), one for taking the brightness measurements (measured from voltage divider of a resistor and a photoresistor) and another one that uses the motor driver code from project 3. The master code first sets the motor driver Arduino to operational mode (the PI-controller coefficients are already set in the preoperational mode), then in a loop it takes brighness measurements and inputs them into a PI-controller on the Pi. The PI controller outputs a reference speed which is then sent to the motor server. This way it tries to keep the moving average of the brighness level at the reference brightness level.
